<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Transfer learning with Tensorflow and keras


A small project to evaluate the suitability and ease of use of tensorflow2 for transfer learning. The project is based 
around creating a convolutional GAN and the MNIST data set. Methods to transfer weights between various architectures 
for classification, generation and discrimination are trialled.

## Architectures

* RESNET
* UNET

### Built With

* Tensorflow
* Keras
